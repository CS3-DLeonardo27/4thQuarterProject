        <p>
            Renewable energy sources are essential for a sustainable future, providing clean alternatives to fossil fuels. Wind energy harnesses<br>
            the power of wind through turbines to generate electricity, offering a reliable and widely-used solution. Solar energy captures sunlight<br>
            using photovoltaic cells, converting it into electricity and providing a versatile and abundant energy source. Nuclear energy, though<br>
            not renewable in the traditional sense, offers a low-carbon option by utilizing nuclear reactions to produce vast amounts of power.<br>
            Wave energy exploits the kinetic energy of ocean waves, converting it into electricity and tapping into the immense energy potential<br> 
            of our seas. Together, these technologies represent critical components in the global transition to a greener energy landscape.

        <h3>The lessons about Alternative Energy Sources are provide below:</h3>
        <a href="Lesson1.html"><h3 style="color: black;"><u>Lesson 1: Wind Energy</u></h3>        </a>
        <p>Wind energy, which transforms the power of an inexhaustible resource such as wind into electricity, is a sustainable and valuable <br>
        investment for the future. Utilising wind requires the construction of wind farms, either on land or at high sea, with dozens of<br> wind turbines.
        </p>

        <a href="Lesson2.html"><h3 style="color: black;"><u>Lesson 2: Solar Energy</u></h3>        </a>
        <p>
            Solar energy is an inexhaustible source of renewable energy, and is a sustainable and clean alternative to polluting energy sources.<br> 
            Through photovoltaic and solar thermal installations, this energy is transformed into clean electricity, contributing to the fight<br>
            against climate change, avoiding tons of greenhouse gas emissions each year.
        </p>

        <a href="Lesson3.html"><h3 style="color: black;"><u>Lesson 3: Nuclear Energy</u></h3></a>
        <p>
            Nuclear energy is the energy in the nucleus, or core, of an atom. Atoms are tiny units that make up all matter in the universe,<br>
            and energy is what holds the nucleus together. There is a huge amount of energy in an atom's dense nucleus. In fact, the power<br>
            that holds the nucleus together is officially called the "strong force".
        </p>

        <a href="Lesson4.html"><h3 style="color: black;"><u>Lesson 4: Wave Energy</u></h3></a>
        <p>
            Wave energy is a form of renewable energy that can be harnessed from the motion of the waves. There are several methods<br>
            of harnessing wave energy that involve placing electricity generators on the surface of the ocean.
