        <h3><u>What is Wind Energy?</u></h3>
        <p>
            Wind energy is energy obtained from the force of the wind. How? Through a wind turbine that transforms the kinetic energy of air<br>
            currents into electrical energy. The energy is mainly extracted with the rotor, which transforms the kinetic energy into mechanical<br>
            energy, and with the generator, which transforms this mechanical energy into electrical energy. We are talking about a renewable,<br>
            efficient, mature and secure energy that is key to the energy transition and the decarbonisation of the economy.
        </p>
        
        <h3><u>Wind Turbines</u></h3>
        <p>As we have already mentioned, in order to utilise the kinetic energy of the wind and convert it into electrical energy, it is<br> 
        necessary to use a wind turbine. The optimal use of these giants, (they are usually between 80 and 120 metres high) depends on<br>
        the strength of the wind. For this reason, wind farms, which pool a large number of wind turbines and make it possible to<br>
        obtain this energy in large quantities, must be set up in places where windy conditions are predominant.
