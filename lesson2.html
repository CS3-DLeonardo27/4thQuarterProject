        <h3><u>What is Solar Energy?</u></h3>
        <p>
            Solar energy is a form of renewable energy obtained directly from the sun. Solar radiation or heat is harnessed to generate<br>
            electricity, making it a clean and sustainable alternative to conventional energy sources that produce polluting emissions.<br><br>
            It is an inexhaustible and abundant source of energy, as the sun continuously emits enormous amounts of radiation that can be<br>
            harnessed. Furthermore, its use contributes to reducing dependence on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change by not generating<br>
            greenhouse gas emissions during operation.<br><br>
            Solar energy is obtained through technologies such as photovoltaic and solar thermal. Photovoltaics converts sunlight directly into <br>
            electricity through solar panels, while solar thermal uses mirrors to concentrate the sun's heat to generate steam that drives turbines<br>
            to produce electricity.
        </p>

        <h3><u>How Does Solar Energy Work?</u></h3>
        <p>
            The process of capturing solar energy is divided into four distinct phases when it comes to photovoltaic solar energy: <br>
            capturing light, generating electricity, transforming it into alternating current and storing or transporting it.<br><br>
            Firstly, light is collected by photovoltaic solar panels. These are composed of photovoltaic cells that contain, in turn, layers of<br>
            semiconductor materials. These materials are capable of absorbing photons and releasing electrons.<br><br>
            In the case of solar thermal energy, light is captured by mirrors and heat receivers. The process of harnessing solar thermal energy<br>
            to produce electricity is based on principles similar to those of steam engines, which use it to drive a turbine that activates an<br> electric generator.
        </p>
        
        <h3><u>Advantages of Solar Energy</u></h3>
        <p>
            The advantages of solar energy are varied, obvious in some cases, but mostly indicative of how it can provide us with clean and<br>
            abundant energy. In fact, because it comes from the sun, we are assured of a constant supply for a few billion more years, making<br>
            it a renewable energy, coming from an inexhaustible source.<br><br>
            The next most important advantage is that solar power generation does not produce greenhouse gas emissions, which helps<br>
            mitigate climate change and reduces the environmental impact of its operation. Related to this, another advantage of solar energy<br>
            systems is that they tend to have low operating and maintenance costs, which can contribute to a more stable and predictable<br> energy supply.<br><br>

            In turn, the use of solar energy means reducing dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels. This helps to be less vulnerable to price<br>
            fluctuations and contributes to maintaining a well-balanced energy mix.<br><br>

            Another major advantage is that it is a naturally generated energy source, and it can also be considered decentralised: solar energy<br>
            can be managed in a variety of locations, from large photovoltaic fields to smaller commercial and residential installations.<br><br>

            As mentioned above, once installed, systems that process solar energy have relatively low operating and maintenance costs. In addition,<br>
            individuals and businesses can generate their own electricity, which contributes to a more efficient electricity grid and saves money <br>for the consumer.<br><br>
