        <h3><u>What is Wave Energy?</u></h3>
        <p>
            Wave energy is a form of renewable energy that can be harnessed from the motion of the waves. There are several methods of<br>
            arnessing wave energy that involve placing electricity generators on the surface of the ocean.It’s true! Wave energy is another<br>
            form of renewable energy that can be used as an alternative to traditional energy from fossil fuels – finite resources that release<br>
            harmful carbon emissions into the air when harnessed for energy.
        </p>

        <h3><u>How does Wave Energy work?</u></h3>
        <p>
            Did you know that waves are actually caused by tides, which vary depending on the lunar cycles? That’s right – you can blame<br>
            the moon for those days of rough surf on the beach. Depending on the lunar cycles, tides, winds, and weather, waves can vary in<br>
            size and strength. As waves roll through the ocean, they create kinetic energy, or movement. This movement can be used to power <br>
            turbines, which, in turn, create energy that can be converted into electricity and power. There are also several ways of harnessing<br>
            wave energy that utilize the up and down motion of the waves to power pistons/turn generators.
        </p>
        <h3><u>What makes Wave Energy a Renewable Energy Source?</u></h3>
        <p>
            Similar to solar, wind, and geothermal energy, wave energy is a renewable source. As long as the Earth continues to track around the<br>
            sun, and the moon around the Earth, waves will continue to be a viable source of kinetic energy. Wave energy also produces fewer<br>
            carbon emissions than energy from traditional fossil fuels, such as coal or oil, making it a more eco-friendly option.
        </p>

        <h3><u>What's the catch with Wave Energy?</u></h3>
        <p>
            One of the bigger roadblocks to wave energy is that most wave energy systems are fairly small, and aren’t suitable for powering<br>
            large buildings or structures. Another problem with wave energy is that, similar to solar or wind power, the amount of energy that<br>
            can be harnessed is contingent upon the size of the waves at any given time. Variable factors that go into wave energy include the<br>
            wave height, wave speed, wavelength, and wave density – all of which can be unpredictable. As technologies develop, scientists and <br>
            experts are looking at ways to harness more power from waves and the ocean.
