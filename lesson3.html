        <h3><u>What is Nuclear Energy?</u></h3>
        <p>
            Nuclear energy is a form of energy released from the nucleus, the core of atoms, made up of protons and neutrons. This source of<br>
            energy can be produced in two ways: fission – when nuclei of atoms split into several parts – or fusion – when nuclei fuse together.<br>
            The nuclear energy harnessed around the world today to produce electricity is through nuclear fission, while technology to generate<br> electricity from fusion is at the R&D phase.
        </p>

        <h3><u>What is Nuclear Fission?</u></h3>
        <p>
            Nuclear fission is a reaction where the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei, while releasing energy. For instance,<br>
            when hit by a neutron, the nucleus of an atom of uranium-235 splits into two smaller nuclei, for example a barium nucleus and<br>
            a krypton nucleus and two or three neutrons. These extra neutrons will hit other surrounding uranium-235 atoms, which will also <br>
            split and generate additional neutrons in a multiplying effect, thus generating a chain reaction in a fraction of a second. Each time <br>
            the reaction occurs, there is a release of energy in the form of heat and radiation. The heat can be converted into electricity in<br>
            a nuclear power plant, similarly to how heat from fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil is used to generate electricity.
        </p>

        <h3><u>How does Nuclear power plant work?</u></h3>
        <p>
            Inside nuclear power plants, nuclear reactors and their equipment contain and control the chain reactions, most commonly fuelled<br> 
            by uranium-235, to produce heat through fission. The heat warms the reactor’s cooling agent, typically water, to produce steam. The<br>
            steam is then channelled to spin turbines, activating an electric generator to create low-carbon electricity.
